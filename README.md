# Server-alive-Checker
what this does is pretty easy.
Currently one game is supported and that is DayZ SA
replaces all of the batch files, so those are no longer needed to make the server run.
Checks every 60 seconds if the server has crashed, and if so, it will automatically restart.
support command line attributes.
support timed restarts(experimental)

In the future:
Sent messages if your server crashed
maybe replacement for the shitty BEC
